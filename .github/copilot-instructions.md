<!-- client -->

We use Angular 20 in our client. It uses Angular Material for UI components
and tailwind css for layout and positioning.
Do not use explicit colors or custom scss if not necessary. 
Rather rely on the libraries and their primary colors and styling.
We use signals and standalone components.

<!-- project management -->
We use spring boot with keycloak for user management and project management.
A user will have a role per project, he has access to.
When a user creates a project, he gets the role of the project.
Everybody in a project can add new users to the project.
