# TraceClient

This project uses Angular 20 with [angular material component library](https://material.angular.dev/components/categories) and [tailwind css](https://tailwindcss.com/docs) for layouts.

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools to [generate components](https://angular.dev/cli/generate)

### views
```bash
ng generate component views/name.view --standalone
```

### components shared between views
```bash
ng generate component components/name.component --standalone
```

### api services
```bash
ng generate service services/name.api
```

### state management
```bash
ng generate service states/name.state
```

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.
